Python TkkrLab bot for #tkkrlab irc channel

This is the irc bot on the freenode #tkkrlab channel. Its used for our 
hackerspace TkkrLab to do some functions for our members. Right now
the following function are available:

!status - show if the space is open (based on local file)
!led - update led board with message
!help - show all available commands
!quote - show a quote (from the included qoute file)

to run this script you need to have the additional files:
quotes.txt - file with the quotes (shorted to 140 chars, so it can also be user for our tweet status script)
status.txt - file with open ('1') or closed status ('0'), this is updated by another script.


Script has two modes, a test mode and a live mode.

For normal operation start the bot with 

$ python irc.py

If you want to test functions you can start it wih

$ python irc.py test

This script is released under public domain, you can do what you want.

If you have any remarks or questions let me know at zeno4ever@gmail.com

Happy hacking,

Dave
